A display unit is used to display the number of customers waiting in the queue. Whenever a customer leaves the queue, the count is reduced by one and the count is increased by one if a customer joins a queue. Two sensors (control signals) are used to sense customers leaving and joining the queue respe ctively. Design a circuit that displays the number of customers waiting in the queue in binary format using LEDs. Binary 1 is represented by LED glow and 0 otherwise.

List of Challenging Experiments (Indicative) 1. Postman Problem A postman needs to walk down every street in his area in order to deliver the mail. Assume that the distances between the streets along the roads are given. The postman starts at the post office and returns back to the post office after delivering all the mails. Implement an algorithm to help the post man to walk minimum distance for the purpose . 10 hours 2. Budget Allocation for Marketing Campaign A mobile manufacturing company has got several marketing options such as 15 hours Radio advertisement campaign, TV non peak hours campaign, City top paper network, Viral marketing campaign, Web advertising. From their previous experience, they have got a statistics about paybacks for each marketing option. Given the marketing budget (rupees in crores) for the current year and details of paybacks for each option, implement an algorithm to determine the amount that shall spent on each marketing option so that the company attains the maximum profit . 3. Missionaries and Cannibals Three missionaries and three cannibals are on one side of a river, along with a boat that can hold one or two people. Implement an algorithm to find a way to get everyone to the other side of the river, without ever leaving a group of missionaries in one place outnumbered by the cannibals in that place . 10 hours 4. Register Allocation Problem A register is a component of a computer processor that can hold any type of data and can be accessed faster. As registers are faster to access, it is desirable to use them to the maximum so that the code execution is faster. For each code submitted to the processor, a register interference graph (RIG) is constructed. In a RIG, a node represents a temporary variable and an edge is added between two nodes (variables) t1 and t2 if they are live simultaneously at some point in the program. During register allocation, two temporaries can be allocated to the same register if there is no edge connecting them. Given a RIG representing the dependencies between variables in a code, implement an algorithm to determine the number of registers required to store the variables and speed up the code execution 15 hours 5. Selective Job Scheduling Problem A server is a machine that waits for requests from other machines and responds to them. The purpose of a server is to share hardware and software resources among clients. All the clients submit the jobs to the server for execution and the server may get multiple requests at a time. In such a situation, the server schedule the jobs submitted to it based on some criteria and logic. Each job contains two values namely time and memory required for execution. Assume that there are two servers that schedules jobs based on time and memory. The server s are named as Time Schedule Server and memory Schedule Server respectively. Design a OOP model and implement the time Schedule Server and memory Schedule Server. The Time Schedule Server arranges jobs based on time required for execution in ascending orde r whereas memory Schedule Server arranges jobs based on memory required for execution in ascending order 15 hours 6. Fragment Assembly in DNA Sequencing DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the hereditary material in humans and 15 hours almost all other organisms. Th e information in DNA is stored as a code made up of four chemical bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). In DNA sequencing, each DNA is sheared into millions of small fragments (reads) which assemble to form a single genomic sequen ce (superstring). Each read is a small string. In such a fragment assembly, given a set of reads, the objective is to determine the shortest superstring that contains all the reads. For example, given a set of strings, 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 11 1 the shortest superstring is 0001110100. Given a set of reads, implement an algorithm to find the shortest superstring that contains all the given reads . 7. House Wiring An electrician is wiring a house which has many rooms.
