Implement an algorithm to find a way to get everyone to the other side of the river, without ever leaving a group of missionaries in one place outnumbered by the cannibals in that place.

# 4. Register Allocation Problem

15 hours

A register is a component of a computer processor that can hold any type of data and can be accessed faster. As registers are faster to access, it is desirable to use them to the maximum so that the code execution is faster. For each code submitted to the processor, a register interference graph (RIG) is constructed. In a RIG, a node represents a temporary variable and an edge is added between two nodes (variables) t1 and t2 if they are live simultaneously at some point in the program. During register allocation, two temporaries can be allocated to the same register if there is no edge connecting them. Given a RIG representing the dependencies between variables in a code, implement an algorithm to determine the number of registers required to store the variables and speed up the code execution.

# 5. Selective Job Scheduling Problem

15 hours

A server is a machine that waits for requests from other machines and responds to them. The purpose of a server is to share hardware and software resources among clients. All the clients submit the jobs to the server for execution and the server may get multiple requests at a time. In such a situation, the server schedule the jobs submitted to it based on some criteria and logic. Each job contains two values namely time and memory required for execution. Assume that there are two servers that schedules jobs based on time and memory. The servers are named as Time Schedule Server and memory Schedule Server respectively. Design a OOP model and implement the time Schedule Server and memory Schedule Server. The Time Schedule Server arranges jobs based on time required for execution in ascending order whereas memory Schedule Server arranges jobs based on memory required for execution in ascending order.

# 6. Fragment Assembly in DNA Sequencing

15 hours

DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the hereditary material in humans and# Content Overview

Almost all other organisms. The information in DNA is stored as a code made up of four chemical bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). In DNA sequencing, each DNA is sheared into millions of small fragments (reads) which assemble to form a single genomic sequence (superstring). Each read is a small string. In such a fragment assembly, given a set of reads, the objective is to determine the shortest superstring that contains all the reads. For example, given a set of strings, 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111 the shortest superstring is 0001110100. Given a set of reads, implement an algorithm to find the shortest superstring that contains all the given reads.

The prescribed projects will help the students to understand the fundamentals of web mining and social network analysis inference by examining some simple ontology models. Students will develop the skill of web mining and social network analysis with ontology framework through machine learning algorithms and techniques.

Projects, including machine learning predictive models in an ontology framework; More advanced models will then be explored by the students through these practical hands-on programming. Special emphasis will be given on how students choose evaluation metrics and how they evaluate those prescribed models influenced by ontology and social network analysis framework.

This course aims to equip students with the skills to perform and interpret Bayesian data analyses. The prescribed hands-on projects will help the students to understand the fundamentals of Bayesian inference by examining some simple Bayesian models. Students will develop the skill of interpreting the visual graphs concerning the Bayesian Data Analysis perspective. More advanced models will then be explored by the students through these Bayesian computational methods, especially projects, including linear regression and hierarchical models in a Bayesian framework. Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods will progressively be introduced as practical hands-on programming, and how they evaluate those prescribed models influenced by the Bayesian framework. Special emphasis will be given on how students choose evaluation metrics.
